# Study Plan

# Study Plan

- **Time Allocation**: Allocate more time to complex courses like Math 235 and Math 222. Balance understanding concepts and practical exercises for Comp 273 and Comp 206.

- **Understanding Over Memorization**: Focus on understanding the logic behind formulas in math and the workings of algorithms or systems in computer science.

- **Regular Practice**: Regularly solve math problems and write code to apply what you've learned.

- **Use Resources**: Utilize textbooks, online resources, professor office hours, and discussions with classmates.

- **Review and Revise**: Regularly review and revise the material to reinforce your memory and understanding.

- **Health**: Maintain a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep, a balanced diet, and regular exercise.

Remember, the goal is understanding and learning, not just grades. Build a strong foundation in these subjects for future courses and career.
